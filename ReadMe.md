# MS3 Coding Challenge

This is a coding challenge from MS3.

## Requirements:

1. Create a Java Application to Read and PArse a CSV formatted file
2. Verify Records to ensure they are complete, ensuring nothing is empty.
3. Insert valid data into a SQLite Database.
4. If the Data is bad, Write the data into a separate CSV file.
5. Write a log file that outputs the amount of records recieved, the number of successful records, and the number of        unsucessful records.

## Instructions to Run Program

1. Download the Github folder zip from the repository.
2. Extract the zip folder and open the contents.

From there you have two options of running the program:

### Using The Jar File:

1. Locate The MS3Challenge Executable within the folder.
2. Run the Executable, and the program will run automatically.

### Using Eclipse

1. Open Eclipse and add the folder directory to the list.
2. Ensure all libraries have been carried over sucessfully.
3. Compile and Test Using Eclipse


## Assumptions

1. The File directories where the CVS files and output are static. These can be changed to different directories within the code.
2. A header will always exist within a CVS file.
3. Data does not have to be modified before being palced in the database file.
